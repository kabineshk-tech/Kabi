# reference/

Design references, brand assets, and documentation artifacts.

## Rules
- Nothing here is imported by source code — reference only
- Store design files, wireframes, brand guidelines, and API docs here
- Use subfolders for organisation

## Suggested Structure
```
brand/          → Brand guidelines, color palettes, typography specs
designs/        → Wireframes, mockups (Figma exports, screenshots)
api-docs/       → External API documentation or Postman collections
```

## Notes
- Files in this folder are not served or bundled
- Keep file sizes reasonable — large binaries (> 5MB) should be gitignored
